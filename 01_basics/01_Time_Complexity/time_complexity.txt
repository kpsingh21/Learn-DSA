What is Time complexity ?
:: Rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size. 
time complexity != time taken
time v/s input 	Î¸

How it measure ?
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes how a function grows as its input increases. 
f(n)=O(g(n))

Time complexty calculation rule:
1.Always calculate in terms of worst case scenarios
2. Avoid constants
3. Avoid Lower values

Big o nation : worst case upper bond
thetha : Average complexity
omega : lowest bond
__________________________________________
Space complexity -> Memory Space also measured in Big O
space complexity is Auxilary space + Input space
Auxilary space is the space that you take to solve the problem
Input space is the space that you talk to store the Input


c= a+b ; c is avxilary space and a and b is input space

ex:  int a[N]; o[N]

1sec = (10)^8 operation
time limit 1 sec is roughly O(10^8)operation
